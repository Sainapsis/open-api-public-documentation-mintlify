## Two Ways (bidirectional integration)

Bridge provides bidirectional integration to push and receive contact related events from your CRM to Bridge and vice versa:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  >
    **Contact event push into bridge** - Create, read, update, and delete
    contacts with full CRUD operations via API REST
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Webhooks"
    icon="webhook"
    href="/api-reference/webhooks/receive-bridge-event-notifications"
  >
    **Real-time Events from Bridge to your CRM** - Receive instant notifications
    when events occur in Bridge to maintain your CRM up to date.
