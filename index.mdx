Through this website, developers can integrate Bridge with other systems such as automation platforms, CRMs, lead management tools, and custom SaaS applications, enabling seamless data exchange and synchronized workflows between Bridge and their existing technology stack."

### **Comprehensive Guide for CRM and Platform Integration**

The Bridge API and Webhooks enable seamless, bidirectional integration between Bridge and your CRM or other business systems. This means your platform can both:

- Push data into Bridge — for example, sending contact details, messages, create new conversations, or lead updates from your CRM so they appear instantly in Bridge or allow your Bridge users to be connected immediately with your customers.
- Receive data from Bridge — for example, when a new conversation or contact is created / updated, Bridge can send event notifications (webhooks) back to your system in real time. This will allow you to have your CRM up to date.
