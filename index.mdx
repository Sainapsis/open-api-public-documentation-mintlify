Through this website, developers can integrate Bridge with other systems such as automation platforms, CRMs, lead management tools, and custom SaaS applications, enabling seamless data exchange and synchronized workflows between Bridge and their existing technology stack."

### **Why use our API or Webhooks?**

The Bridge API and Webhooks enable seamless, bidirectional integration between Bridge and your internal systems, CRM or any other business systems. This means your platforms can both:

- <Icon icon="code" iconType="solid" color="#2563EB" /> **Push data into Bridge** — Send structured data from your system (e.g. CRM or automation platform) directly into Bridge.

  You can use this to:
  - Create or update contacts and leads
  - Post messages or trigger new conversations
  - Sync lead status or activity updates in real time

  This ensures that any changes or new interactions from your CRM appear instantly inside Bridge, allowing Bridge users to immediately engage with your customers.
- <Icon icon="webhook" iconType="solid" color="#2563EB" /> **Receive data from Bridge** — Bridge can send real-time event notifications (via webhooks) to your system whenever key actions occur, such as when a new contact or conversation is created or updated.

  By subscribing to these webhook events, your CRM or external system can stay automatically synchronized with Bridge — ensuring your contact and conversation data is always up to date.
