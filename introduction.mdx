## Authentication

All requests to the Bridge API require authentication via an **API Key** and **API Secret**. \
Please note that you will have to encode in **Base 64** your API Key and your API secret separated by a colon (:)

### Example:

**API Key** = _THISISTHEKEYABC123456789XYZ_\
**API Secret** = _THISISTHESECRETQWERTY1234567890XYZ_\
**Text to encode in Base 64**: _THISISTHEKEYABC123456789XYZ_:_THISISTHESECRETQWERTY1234567890XYZ_

> **After encodig in Base64 your athetication key will look like:** VEhJU0lTVEhFS0VZQUJDMTIzNDU2Nzg5WFlaOlRISVNJU1RIRVNFQ1JFVFFXRVJUWTEyMzQ1Njc4OTBYWVo=

### Where to find your API Credentials

1. Go to your [Bridge Dashboard](https://admin.bridge.new)
2. Navigate in the left pannel to **Developers → API Keys Management**
3. Click **Generate New Key** to get:
   - **API Key (public)** — used to identify your account.
   - **API Secret (private)** — used to sign and authenticate your requests.

⚠️ **Important:**\
Keep your API Secret safe — never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Also we will not be able to show your API Secret again, so make sure you don't loose it.
