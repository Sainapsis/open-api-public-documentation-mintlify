# Bridge Public API and Webhooks for integrations documentation projects

we use openapi.yml to define pages (in the future we may customize it with mdx files, but for now we will use only openapi.yml)

## current structure (derived directly from open api def)

is specified directly as the openapi.yml in the docs.json

run this in your terminal for openapi def check:

```
mint openapi-check api-reference/openapi.yaml
```

## check broken links

```
mint broken-links
```

note: broken links will be reported if the mdx files are not pregernated (so its ok for our current aproach with autogenerated pages from open api def)

## run locally

mintlify dev

## Possible future customizations strategy (avoid it for now)

we could run the following command to autogenrate mdx from openapi.yml definition and then customize it

```
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file api-reference/openapi.yaml -o api-reference
```
