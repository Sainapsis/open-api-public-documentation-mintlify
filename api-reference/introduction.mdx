## Welcome

The Bridge API provides two main functionalities:

1. **Webhook Receiver API** - Endpoints that CRM clients implement to receive event notifications from Bridge
2. **Contact CRUD API** - Endpoints provided by Bridge for managing contacts

This documentation is built using [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) specification.

## Authentication

All Bridge API endpoints (Contact CRUD) use API key authentication designed for machine-to-machine communication. Webhook endpoints do not require authentication as they are implemented by the client.

### API Key Authentication

Bridge uses a secure API key system with access keys and secret keys:

1. **Generate API Keys**: Create an access key and secret key pair from your Bridge dashboard
2. **Include Access Key**: Add your access key in the `X-API-Key` header
3. **Sign Requests**: Sign your requests using HMAC-SHA256 with your secret key
4. **Include Signature**: Add the signature in the `X-API-Signature` header

### Request Signing Process

To sign your requests:

1. Create a string to sign in this format:

   ```
   {HTTP_METHOD}\n{REQUEST_PATH}\n{REQUEST_BODY}\n{TIMESTAMP}
   ```

2. Generate an HMAC-SHA256 signature using your secret key

3. Include these headers in your request:
   ```
   X-API-Key: ak_1234567890abcdef
   X-API-Timestamp: 1642234567
   X-API-Signature: a1b2c3d4e5f6...
   ```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bridge.com/api/workspaces/ws_abc123/contacts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: ak_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "X-API-Timestamp: 1642234567" \
  -H "X-API-Signature: a1b2c3d4e5f6..." \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"john@example.com"}'
```

```yaml
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []
```

## Webhook Events

Bridge sends event notifications to client-implemented webhook endpoints when significant events occur in the system. Events include:

- `user.daily_resume_generated` - When a daily resume is generated for a user
- `task.created` - When a new task is created
- `task.updated` - When a task is modified
- `task.completed` - When a task is marked as complete
- `opportunity.created` - When a new opportunity is created
- `opportunity.updated` - When an opportunity is modified

## Contact Management

The Contact CRUD API allows clients to manage contacts in the Bridge system with full create, read, update, and delete operations. All contacts must have a cellphone number, while email addresses are optional.
