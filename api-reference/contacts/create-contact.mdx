## Overview

The Create Contact endpoint allows you to add new contacts to your Bridge workspace. This endpoint supports both email and cellphone contact methods, with cellphone being required.

## Key Features

- **Multi-tenant**: All contacts are scoped to a specific workspace
- **Flexible attributes**: Support for custom key-value attributes
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with detailed error responses
- **Optional email**: Email is optional, making this suitable for phone-only contact scenarios

## Common Use Cases

1. **CRM Integration**: Import contacts from external CRM systems
2. **Lead Capture**: Create contacts from web forms or marketing campaigns
3. **Mobile Apps**: Add contacts with phone numbers from mobile applications

## Best Practices

- Always include the `workspaceId` in the path to ensure proper tenant isolation
- Use the `customAttributes` array for storing additional contact metadata
- Handle the 404 response for invalid workspace IDs gracefully
- Consider implementing retry logic for network failures

## Error Handling

The endpoint returns specific error codes:

- `400`: Invalid contact data (missing required fields, invalid format)
- `404`: Workspace not found or user doesn't have access

Make sure to validate required fields (`firstName`, `lastName`, `cellphone`) before making the request.
