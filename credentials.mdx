## Authentication

All requests to the Bridge API require authentication via an **API Key**.

### Where to find your API Credentials

1. Go to your [Bridge Dashboard](https://admin.bridge.new)
2. Navigate in the left pannel to **Developers → API Keys Management**
3. Click **Generate New Key** to get:
   - **API Id** — used to identify your account.
   - **API Key** — used to sign and authenticate your requests.

⚠️ **Important:**\
Keep your API Key safe — never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Also we will not be able to show your API Key again, so make sure you don't loose it.
