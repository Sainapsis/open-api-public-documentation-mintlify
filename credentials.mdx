## Authentication

All requests to the Bridge API require authentication via an **API Key**.

### Where to find your API Credentials

1. Go to your [Bridge Dashboard](https://admin.bridge.new)
2. Navigate in the left pannel to **Developers → API Keys Management**
3. Click **Generate New Key** to get:
   - **API Id** — used to identify your account.
   - **API Key** — used to sign and authenticate your requests.

<Warning>
  <u>Keep your API Key secure </u>— never include it in client-side code or public repositories.

  For security reasons, we won’t be able to display your API Key again, so make sure to store it safely and don’t lose it.
</Warning>
