Bridge webhooks deliver structured event payloads in JSON format whenever specific actions occur in your workspace.  
Each event follows a consistent schema to make parsing and validation simple.

---

## Common Event Structure

All webhook events share the same top-level structure:

```json
{
  "eventId": "string", // Unique event identifier
  "eventType": "string", // Type of event (entity.action)
  "entity": "string", // Entity affected by the event
  "workspaceId": "string", // Your Bridge workspace ID
  "timestamp": "string", // ISO 8601 timestamp
  "payload": {} // Event-specific data
}
```

## Conversation Summaries (`v1`)

Triggered whenever conversation summaries are created, updated, or deleted.

### Example Payload

  "eventId": "evt_123456789",

## Notes

- Bridge may add new event categories in the future.
- Always check the `eventType` field to determine which handler to execute.
- Webhook payloads are versioned â€” ensure your integration supports the declared version in each event.
